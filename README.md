# **Infosys Data Science Internship Project**

This repository contains the work and insights from my Data Science internship at Infosys, where I focused on analyzing customer data and developing predictive models to reduce churn for a telecom company.

## **Internship Overview**

During my internship at Infosys, I had the opportunity to apply data science techniques to real-world customer data, processing over 10,000 records. My primary goal was to develop predictive models that could accurately identify at-risk customers, ultimately helping the company reduce customer churn by 20%.

## **Key Technologies & Tools**

- **Python**: Used for data analysis, processing, and model development.
  
- **Pandas**: Leveraged for data manipulation and cleaning.
  
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for building and evaluating machine learning models.
  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization to gain insights and communicate findings.

## **Project Highlights**

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed a large dataset containing customer information, including demographics, usage patterns, and service history.
  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models with an accuracy of 85% to predict customer churn.
  
- **Business Impact**: Provided actionable insights that contributed to a 20% reduction in customer churn for the telecom company.
